<h1>The Best Movies According to Guuh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies/animations all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Adventure Time:</h3>
<p>Adventure Time features two characters, Finn the human and Jake his dog. Finn seeks to be a hero while Jake is his companion during his journey. The fun is in feeling the light atmosphere of the setting, it brings a sense of peace during the adventure process, the combats in the series always provide good life lessons as well as being very cool and are also lessons that make us reflect on our behavior, most of the time it breaks a bubble and shows us individual ignorance, which helps us grow as people. I hope you enjoy it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π</p>

<h3>Avatar the legend of Aang:</h3>
<p>I like to talk about the atmosphere of the work, I like to feel connected to that point, so about the atmosphere of avatar the legend of aang, it's a welcoming atmosphere, it's about characters who reproduce reflections of burdens in most cases as they progress, it shows how they forgive and accept themselves, it brings a narrative of self-love and overcoming. It also provides a framework to teach us how to overcome our differences. Aang was also special in my evolution as a person. </p>

<h3>One Piece:</h3>
<p>One Piece is a story set in the pirate world. What some people like, others end up feeling the opposite about the number of episodes, but it's precisely the number of episodes that makes it possible to follow the whole adventure from 0 to 100 without missing a single detail. The atmosphere brings a sense of adventure and freedom and it's a bit complex to connect with a character, in most cases you'll connect with their purpose and not with what they're actually like and that's great.</p>
